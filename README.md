## Introduction
This project aims to help a FinTech company grow its business by identifying potential customers who might need special offers to purchase their app. The company collects data during a 24-hour free trial and uses this data to recommend the app and tailor offers to customers who are less likely to purchase without incentives.

## Problem Statement
The company launched their Android and iOS mobile app and wants to grow their user base. They provided a 24-hour free trial for all customers and collected data on whether the customers purchased the app after the trial. The goal is to use this data to create a model that can classify which customers would benefit from special offers, thereby increasing sales and customer retention.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features collected during the 24-hour trial period, such as user demographics, app usage statistics, and purchase behavior. The target variable indicates whether a customer purchased the app (1) or did not (0).

## Data Analysis and Machine Learning Process
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the data distribution, relationships, and key features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features and select important ones for the model.
4. **Model Building:** Train classification models to predict customer behavior.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model parameters to improve performance.
7. **Prediction and Recommendation:** Use the model to classify customers and recommend special offers.

## Results and Findings
The analysis and machine learning models provided the following insights:
- Key features influencing purchase behavior include app usage frequency, user demographics, and interaction with app features.
- The classification models can effectively identify customers who are less likely to purchase without special offers.
- Recommendations for special offers can be tailored based on model predictions to increase conversion rates.

## Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning, the FinTech company can effectively identify potential customers who need special offers to purchase the app. This targeted approach helps in optimizing marketing efforts and growing the business.
